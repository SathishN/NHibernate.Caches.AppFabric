This project is an NHibernate second-level cache provider for App Fabric. This project is based on the original implementation for the beta versions of AppFabric caching, code named velocity which can be found at https://github.com/martinernst/NHibernate.Caches/tree/master/Velocity. The velocity provider project is not actively being maintained and therefore I have created this new project.

In addition to being actively maintained, this provider also provides a number of additional features in addition to the basic implementation provided by the velocity version.
